## hello moon 🌘

I'm a music nerd and developer that wants to learn more things that can fit into my time and mind.

#### my comfort zone

- linux (arch btw)
- neovim
- tmux
- hyprland
- elixir 💧 (kinda recent but I ❤️ it)

#### things that tickle my interest

- rust 🦀 -> been trying to build a shell.
- machine learning -> I want to learn more about the algorithms behind it and I want to get into Nx and the Elixir ML stack.
